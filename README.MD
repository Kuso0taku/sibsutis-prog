every pract have .c files of codes and 
**makefile** (exclude pract1) to compile all .c (tasks)

so u just need to write ```make``` in your linux console to compile all files

also all executable files names like main .c files.
for example we have "task.c" file 
and compileted executable file will be named "task". and other.

or if we have several files .c for 1 program
executable file will be named like "task{number of task}"
